This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations where data hasn't loaded yet or when using optional chaining incorrectly. For example:

```javascript
//Incorrect
console.log(userData.address.street);

//Correct
console.log(userData?.address?.street);
```

In the incorrect example, if `userData` or `userData.address` is null or undefined, the code will throw a TypeError. The correct example uses optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access the `street` property. If any part of the chain is null or undefined, the expression will short-circuit and return undefined instead of throwing an error.  Another frequent cause is fetching data before the component is mounted or before the data has actually arrived.
